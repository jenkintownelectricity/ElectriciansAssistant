## AI Photo Analysis - Context-Aware Workflow

The AI Photo Analysis feature uses **context-aware analysis** to provide more accurate safety assessments based on the specific electrical problem you're experiencing.

### How It Works

1. **Select a Problem First**
   - Navigate to the Safety Database (30 problems available)
   - Choose the specific issue you're experiencing (e.g., "Circuit Breaker Keeps Tripping")
   
2. **Upload Photos**
   - The app provides specific photo instructions for your selected problem
   - Example: For circuit breakers, you'll be asked to photograph the panel interior, breaker labels, etc.
   
3. **Context-Aware AI Analysis**
   - The AI receives your photos PLUS the problem context
   - Backend API call includes:
```javascript
     {
       image: <base64_image_data>,
       problem: "Circuit Breaker Keeps Tripping",
       context: "Circuit breaker trips repeatedly when certain appliances are used"
     }
```
   - Claude AI analyzes photos specifically looking for issues related to your problem
   - Results are tailored to the selected electrical issue

4. **Get Detailed Results**
   - Issues detected specific to your problem
   - NEC code violations identified
   - Step-by-step remediation recommendations
   - Safety warnings prioritized by severity

### Why Context Matters

**Without Context:** AI might miss problem-specific issues or provide generic analysis

**With Context:** 
- For "Hot Outlet" ‚Üí AI looks specifically for overload signs, loose connections, arcing
- For "GFCI Tripping" ‚Üí AI checks for moisture, ground faults, worn insulation
- For "Flickering Lights" ‚Üí AI examines connections, dimmer compatibility, voltage issues

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/analyze`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  "problem": "Circuit Breaker Keeps Tripping",
  "context": "Circuit breaker trips repeatedly when certain appliances are used or randomly"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "summary": "Analysis summary",
    "issues": [
      {
        "type": "critical",
        "title": "Overloaded Circuit",
        "description": "Circuit shows signs of excessive load",
        "location": "Panel breaker #5",
        "nec_reference": "210.20(A)"
      }
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Replace 15A breaker with 20A",
      "Verify wire gauge supports 20A load",
      "Add dedicated circuit for high-draw appliance"
    ]
  }
}
```

**This context-aware approach provides significantly more accurate and actionable results than generic photo analysis.**
