   - Click "Enable"

### Step 2: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

   - Application type: Web application
   - Name: "Electrician's Assistant Web Client"
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5173`
5. Copy the **Client ID** (you'll need this)

### Step 3: Create API Key

1. Still in "Credentials", click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
2. Copy the **API Key** (you'll need this)
3. (Optional) Click "Restrict Key" to limit to Calendar API only

### Step 4: Get Your Calendar IDs

You need the Calendar IDs for your 4 booking calendars:

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
2. For each calendar (Emergency, Panel Install, Service Call, Estimate):
   - Click the calendar name in the left sidebar
   - Click the 3 dots > "Settings and sharing"
   - Scroll to "Integrate calendar"
   - Copy the **Calendar ID** (looks like: `abc123@group.calendar.google.com`)

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your credentials:
   ```env
   # From Step 2
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com

   # From Step 3
   VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

   # From Step 4
   VITE_CALENDAR_EMERGENCY=emergency-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
   VITE_CALENDAR_PANEL=panel-install-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
   VITE_CALENDAR_SERVICE=service-call-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
   VITE_CALENDAR_ESTIMATE=estimate-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com

```

### Step 7: Sign In

## Usage

### Viewing Schedule

- **Today's appointments** appear in the right sidebar
- **Color-coded** by job type:
  - üö® Red = Emergency
  - ‚ö° Blue = Panel Install
  - üîß Yellow = Service Call
  - üìã Green = Estimate

### Event Details

- **Click any event** to see:
  - Client name and contact info
  - Location with "Get Directions" button
  - Job duration and time
  - Status (Upcoming, In Progress, Completed)
  - Quick actions: Call, Email, Navigate

### Sidebar Controls

- **Refresh icon** - Manually refresh schedule
- **Collapse arrow** - Collapse sidebar to save space
- **Stats** - View totals: Jobs, Revenue, Status counts

## Calendar Event Format

For best results, format your Google Calendar events like this:

**Event Title**:
```
John Doe - (555) 123-4567
```
or
```
Jane Smith
```

**Description** (optional):
```
Client email: john@example.com
Special instructions: Gate code 1234
```

**Location**:
```
123 Main St, City, State 12345
```

The app will automatically extract:
- Client name from title
- Phone number from title or description
- Email from description
- Location for directions

## Troubleshooting

### "Not signed in to Google Calendar"
- Make sure you clicked "Sign in with Google" in the sidebar
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console

### "No appointments today"
- Check that calendar IDs in `.env.local` are correct
- Verify you have events in those calendars for today
- Try the refresh button in the sidebar

### Calendar events not loading
- Open browser dev tools (F12) and check for errors
- Verify API key and Client ID are correct
- Make sure Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check that authorized origins include `http://localhost:5173`

### CORS errors
- Verify authorized JavaScript origins in OAuth settings
- Make sure you're accessing from `http://localhost:5173` (not IP address)

## Development Tips
