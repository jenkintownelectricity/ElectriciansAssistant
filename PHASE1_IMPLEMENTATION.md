# Phase 1: Residential Wizard - Implementation Complete

## üéØ Overview

**Phase 1: Residential Wizard** is the foundation of a three-tier product strategy designed to monetize while building. This phase focuses on covering 80% of residential electrical work with 11 critical NEC 2023 articles.

### Product Positioning
- **Name**: Electrician's Assistant - Residential Wizard
- **Target Market**: Residential electricians, small contractors, apprentices
- **Pricing**: $29/month or $199/year (43% savings)
- **Coverage**: 11 NEC articles covering 80% of residential work

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Version Configuration System (`src/config/versions.js`)

Complete tiered version management system with:
- **Three tiers**: Residential, Commercial, Enterprise
- **Feature flags**: Per-tier feature availability
- **Article restrictions**: Version-aware code loading
- **Pricing structure**: Monthly/annual with savings calculations
- **Helper functions**: `getCurrentVersion()`, `hasFeature()`, `hasArticle()`

**Key Features:**
```javascript
- APP_VERSIONS: Complete tier definitions
- getCurrentVersion(): Get active tier
- hasFeature(featureName): Check feature availability
- hasArticle(articleNumber): Check article access
- getNextTier(currentTier): Upsell logic
- calculateAnnualSavings(tier): Pricing calculations
```

### 2. Backend API (`backend/src/main.py`)

Completely rewritten backend with:

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/version` - Version info and capabilities
- `GET /api/nec-codes` - Load codes from Google Sheets (tier-aware)
- `GET /api/nec-codes/search?q=query` - Smart search with relevance scoring
- `GET /api/nec-codes/article/<num>` - Get specific article codes
- `POST /api/dev/submit-code` - On-the-fly code submission
- `POST /api/analyze` - Enhanced photo analysis with residential focus
- `GET /api/health` - Health check with version info

**Key Features:**
- Version-aware code loading (only loads allowed articles)
- Google Sheets integration (CSV import)
- Feature gating (checks tier before allowing access)
- Smart search with weighted relevance scoring
- Dev mode submissions (logs to console in Phase 1)
- Enhanced AI prompts focusing on residential codes
- Comprehensive error handling

**Configuration via Environment Variables:**
```env
APP_VERSION=residential|commercial|enterprise
APP_TIER=basic|professional|enterprise
ENABLE_DEV_MODE=true|false
ENABLE_PHOTO_ANALYSIS=true|false
GOOGLE_SHEETS_BASE_URL=your_sheet_url
```

### 3. Frontend Components

#### DevModeSubmission Component (`src/components/DevModeSubmission.jsx`)

Complete on-the-fly code submission form for field testing:

**Features:**
- Full NEC code entry form
- Required fields: code, article, title, description
- Optional fields: category, application, safety notes, related codes, common violations, photo tips
- Form validation
- Success/error state handling
- Auto-clear after successful submission
- Yellow border styling (DEV ONLY badge)
- POST to `/api/dev/submit-code`

**Use Case**: During field testing, when an electrician encounters a code that's not in the database, they can quickly add it for review without leaving the app.

#### UpgradePrompt Component (`src/components/UpgradePrompt.jsx`)

Smart upsell component that appears when users hit tier limitations:

**Features:**
- Shows next tier information (residential ‚Üí commercial ‚Üí enterprise)
- Displays new features unlocked in next tier
- Pricing comparison (monthly vs annual)
- Savings calculations
- Triggered by feature access attempts
- Gradient blue/purple styling
- Call-to-action button
- Feature benefits with checkmarks
- Usage limits comparison

**Use Case**: When a user tries to access Article 220 (Load Calculations) on Residential tier, this component explains what Commercial tier includes and prompts upgrade.

### 4. Environment Configuration

**Backend `.env` file:**
```env
# API Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Phase 1: Residential Wizard Configuration
APP_VERSION=residential
APP_TIER=basic
ENABLE_DEV_MODE=true
ENABLE_CODE_SUBMISSION=true
ENABLE_PHOTO_ANALYSIS=true
ENABLE_OFFLINE_MODE=false

# Google Sheets Configuration (configure when ready)
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_BASE_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID
```

**Frontend `.env` file:**
```env
VITE_APP_TIER=residential
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tiered Loading System

The system loads only the codes allowed for the current tier:

**Residential Tier (Phase 1):**
- Articles: 110, 210, 240, 250, 310, 314, 334, 404, 406, 408, 410
- Target: 120-150 codes covering 80% of residential work

**Commercial Tier (Phase 2):**
- All residential articles PLUS 23 additional articles
- Includes: load calculations, 3-phase systems, commercial equipment

**Enterprise Tier (Phase 3):**
- ALL NEC 2023 articles
- Full team management, analytics, custom reports

### Data Flow

```
User Request ‚Üí Frontend (checks hasFeature()) ‚Üí
Backend API (checks version) ‚Üí
Google Sheets (loads tier-specific articles) ‚Üí
Response filtered by tier ‚Üí Frontend Display
```

### Dev Mode Workflow

```
Field Electrician encounters missing code ‚Üí
Opens Dev Mode form ‚Üí
Fills in code details ‚Üí
Submits to /api/dev/submit-code ‚Üí
Backend logs to console (Phase 1) ‚Üí
Phase 2: Will write to Google Sheets Dev_Submissions tab ‚Üí

## üöß Known Limitations (To Be Addressed)

1. **Google Sheets not yet populated** - Needs 120-150 codes
2. **App.jsx not yet updated** - Needs version display and component integration
3. **No payment integration** - Stripe integration planned for launch
4. **Dev submissions log only** - Phase 2 will write to Google Sheets
5. **No offline mode yet** - Planned for Phase 2
6. **Search needs optimization** - May need caching for large datasets
